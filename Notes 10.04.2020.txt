MVC

Model	->POJO
View	->client Side
Controller->Logic


POJO->Plain Old Java Object
	private variables
	an empty/no-arg constructor
	parameterised constructor
	getters and setters for the variables
	toString method

GUI--->button click events---->instead of writing logic separately in buttonClick 
				event of each GUI
				We are keeping our logic in a separate class
				called as controller


				instead of passing all the parameters individually
				we are providing a centralised access to data 
				using model
